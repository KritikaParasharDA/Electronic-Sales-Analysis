# Electronic-Sales-Analysis

### Project Overview

Conducted analysis on electronic product sales data to derive actionable insights aimed at optimizing marketing strategies, increasing sales, and enhancing overall business performance.

### Data Sources 
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data" folder containing different excel files for each month's sales data.

### Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Different Python Libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly etc.

### Data Cleaning/ Preperation

In the initial data preperation phase, the following tasks are performed:
1. Data loading and merging.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and manipulation.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
 1. What was best month for sales, How much was earned that month?
 2. Which city had the highest number of sales?
 3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
 4. What products are most often sold together?
 5. What product sold the most? Why it is sold the most?


### Findings


1. December was the most profitable month, led by San Francisco, indicating heightened consumer spending during the holiday season.
2. Optimal advertisement timing around midday and early evening could significantly impact sales performance, aligning with peak purchasing hours and maximizing customer engagement.
3. Strategic product bundling opportunities, particularly with package deals, demonstrated potential to stimulate sales and boost overall profitability.
4. Essential items such as AAA and AA batteries emerged as top-selling products, highlighting their recurring demand and indispensable nature.
5. High-priced items like Apple Airpods and Bose SoundSport Headphones contributed significantly to revenue despite lower sales volumes, underscoring their premium appeal.
6. San Francisco led in sales, followed by Los Angeles and New York City, suggesting potential variations in consumer behavior and market dynamics across regions.
7. Identification of frequently co-purchased products presents opportunities for smart promotions and targeted marketing initiatives.
8. Insights derived from sales analysis provide actionable intelligence for decision-making, guiding strategic initiatives and resource allocation for business growth.
